This Agreement governs your use of the Online Banking and Bill Payment Services (the "Services", as further defined below). Use of the Services is expressly conditioned on your acceptance of this Agreement. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to abide by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you decide not to agree to the terms and conditions discussed herein, you may not use the Services. If the terms and conditions of this Agreement conflict with the terms and conditions contained in any Additional Agreement solely as they apply to online banking and online bill payment services, this Agreement controls; provided, that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are not intended to modify any disclosures or other terms that are required by law and that are provided by the bank in an Additional Agreement. This Agreement shall apply regardless of the means by which the Services are accessed, including, but not limited to, through the URL address “website” electronic mail, or links from another Web site via a computer, mobile device, or any other means of access.
<br></br>
<h4>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES</h4>
1.      The "Services" shall mean all information, materials, content, communications, features, products, services, methods of conducting transactions and transactions available, offered, made, obtained or otherwise provided or used (as applicable) on or through the Online Banking Site, including, but not limited to, the ability to: (a) transfer funds between certain accounts; (b) make bill payments through our Online Bill Pay service and schedule other payments to certain of your accounts; (c) obtain account balance and certain other account information for various bank accounts that you may have (including, without limitation, checking, savings or other deposit accounts, loan accounts, credit card accounts and investment accounts); (d) obtain transaction information on certain of your accounts; (e) download certain account transactions to your Computer; (f) update your address; (g) view online statements; (h) view online check images; (i) order statement copies; (j) order check copies; and/or (k) re-order checks for checking account(s) established at a banking office of bank.
<br></br>
2.      These features are limited to the extent, and subject to the terms, noted herein and in any Additional Agreements that apply to you. The Services shall also be deemed to include any portion of the Online Banking Site and any software used to operate the Services. Subject to all terms hereof, you may use the Services seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day, except for any scheduled or unscheduled interruptions in the Services for maintenance, security or any other reasons, as further described below.
<br></br>
<h4>SECURITY; CONFIDENTIALITY OF ACCESS INFORMATION</h4>
1.      Use of the Services requires a computer or approved mobile device and Internet access connected through an Internet or mobile service provider and with a web browser (for example, Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer). To provide the highest degree of confidentiality and to protect the security of your financial information, you must have an Internet browser that supports 128-bit encryption and secure sockets layer version 3.0 or higher. Use of the Services with lower than 128-bit encryption is strictly prohibited. To the extent you are able to access the Services using lower than 128-bit encryption, we specifically disclaim any and all responsibility for losses resulting from your use of such lower encryption. We may change these requirements from time to time.
<br></br>
2.      You agree to keep your Customer Number, user ID, password, password reminder question and answer and any other security or access information (collectively, "Access Information") confidential to prevent unauthorized access to your account(s) and to prevent unauthorized use of the Services. We recommend that you memorize your Access Information and do not write it down. You agree not to give or make available your Access Information to any unauthorized individual. If you believe the security of your password or any other Access Information has been compromised in any way (for example, your password has been lost or stolen, someone has attempted to use the Services under your Customer Number without your consent, your accounts have been accessed, or someone has transferred money from your account(s) without your permission), you must notify us immediately.
<br></br>
3.      We reserve the right, under certain circumstances, to deny your access to any one or more account(s) or to the Services or any part thereof, or to deny the processing of transactions, in order to maintain or restore security or performance to the Online Banking Site or any other bank Sites and systems. We may do so if we reasonably believe your Access Information has been or may be obtained or is being used or may be used by an unauthorized person(s).
<br></br>
<h4>TRANSFERS</h4>
1.      Your ability to transfer funds from certain accounts is limited by federal law. You should refer to the deposit account agreement which governs your deposit account, a copy of which is available by calling Online Banking Customer Service at 1-877-442-3764 for these legal restrictions and the service charges and penalties for excessive withdrawals or transfers. Transfers made using the Services are included in calculating the permissible number of transfers from certain accounts described in your deposit account agreement.
<br></br>
2.      We reserve the right to impose a frequency or dollar limit on transfers, or to refuse to make any transfer, between certain accounts. We are obligated to notify you promptly if we decide to refuse to complete your transfer instruction; provided, however, that notification is not required if you attempt to make transfers that are prohibited under this Agreement, any Additional Agreement, other bank agreements affecting the terms of your account(s), or federal or state laws.
<br></br>
3.      Except as provided in this Agreement, all Internal Transfer instructions received before 10:00 p.m. Central Time on a Business Day will be posted to your account the same day. All Internal Transfer instructions received on or after 10:00 p.m. Central Time or on a Saturday, Sunday or banking holiday will be posted the next Business Day. Contact Online Banking Customer Service at 1-877-442-3764 for a list of our banking holidays.
<br></br>
<h4>PAYMENTS</h4>
1.      Online payments include (i) payments made through the Services for which the Payment Account is a bank account ("Outgoing Payments"), including, without limitation, any payment that you schedule through our Online Bill Pay service, (ii) payments to certain bank accounts ("Incoming Payments"), and (iii) payments made in the form of funds transfers to eligible loan or line of credit accounts (which are covered by the "Transfers" section above and any other provisions governing transfers in this Agreement). The Payment Account that you designate for an Incoming Payment may or may not be a bank account. You may schedule an Incoming Payment to certain of your accounts, including, without limitation, any bank Auto Finance loan account, using the Services without using the Online Bill Pay service. For certain other accounts (including, without limitation, any MasterCard BusinessCard account or other bank credit card account), you may schedule an Incoming Payment by hyperlinking from the Online Banking Site to the applicable bank Site for such account, and setting up the Incoming Payment on such other bank Site. Any such Incoming Payment that you set up on another bank Site will be governed by terms and conditions set forth on such bank Site and not by this Agreement, except with respect to any Incoming Payment to your MasterCard BusinessCard account (which shall be governed by the payment terms hereof in addition to any such terms and conditions on the bank Site for your MasterCard BusinessCard account).
<br></br>
2.      With respect to Outgoing Payments, if at the time funds are to be removed from your Payment Account, there are insufficient funds, and we pay the bill, you understand and agree that you are responsible for reimbursing bank for the amount of the bill, along with any additional fees or penalties. The dollar amount of these fees or penalties is published in the bank Fee Schedule, available at any bank banking office, via an e-mail request or by calling Online Banking Customer Service at 1-877-442-3764. You further understand that any and all payments by bank in these circumstances are purely at our discretion and that the payment by bank of any bills under these circumstances in no way obligates us to pay the same or similar bills in the future.
<br></br>
3.      You should keep your bill payment accounts open and active. Should your bill pay eligible checking accounts close, your Online Bill Pay services will end and any unprocessed Outgoing Payment transactions will be cancelled. Cancellation of your Online Bill Payment transactions may take up to five (5) business days from the processing date of a payment scheduled from your closed checking account. If you close your Payment Account, any Incoming Payments will not be processed. Outgoing Payments scheduled through Online Bill Payment from the closed Payment Account may be processed, depending on proximity to the Scheduled Due date.
<br></br>
4.      Additional terms regarding Online Bill Pay are set forth in our Online Bill Payment Authorization and Agreement. With respect to Incoming Payments for which your Payment Account is not a bank account, additional terms and conditions established by the financial institution with which you have such Payment Account may apply to such Incoming Payments.
<br></br>
<h4>FEES AND CHARGES</h4>
1.      Except as provided herein, we do not at this time charge any enrollment fees, recurring usage fees or any other fees for your use of the Services (including, without limitation, viewing your account information, transferring funds and making bill payments). However, we do charge fees in certain limited circumstances that may arise in connection with your use of the Services (including, without limitation, if you request a stop payment or order a print copy of a check or statement), as further set forth in the bank Fee Schedule, available at any bank banking office, via an e-mail request or by calling Online Banking Customer Service at 1-877-442-3764. In addition to such fees set forth in such Fee Schedule, you shall be subject to all fees, charges, penalties, balance requirements, and other restrictions explained in your account agreements or other Additional Agreements.
<br></br>
2.      Notwithstanding the foregoing, fees are subject to change, and we may impose additional charges, penalties or fees in connection with your use of the Services at any time, subject to the terms hereof.
<br></br>
3.      You agree to promptly pay all fees and charges for services provided through the Services, and you authorize us to automatically deduct all applicable charges and fees from your designated bank Payment Account(s) or any other eligible account.
<br></br>
4.      You agree to be responsible for any telephone charges and/or Internet service fees you incur in accessing your account(s) through the Services.
<br></br>
<h4>OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR BILL PAYMENTS AND FUNDS TRANSFERS</h4>
1.      By using any payment or funds transfer service available through the Services, you warrant that you are an authorized signer on the account from which the funds are being drawn to make such payment or transfer.
<br></br>
2.      We, or a third party acting as our agent, will use reasonable efforts to timely and properly complete funds transfers and bill payments from your designated checking, savings or other deposit account(s) or from your line of credit account(s) (as applicable) according to your properly entered and transmitted instructions. However, neither a third party service provider nor we will be liable in any way for any failure or delay in completing any such transaction (whether an Outgoing Payment, Incoming Payment or funds transfer, as applicable):
<br></br>
3.      If, through no fault of our own or of our agent, you do not have adequate money in a designated checking, savings or other deposit account to complete a transaction from that account, or if that account has been closed; or the transaction would exceed the credit limit on any applicable overdraft line of credit;
<br></br>
4.      If our payment processing center is not working properly and you know or have been advised by us about the malfunction before you execute your bill payment instructions;
<br></br>
5.      If you have not properly followed instructions on how to make a funds transfer;
<br></br>
6.      If you do not provide bank with complete, correct and current Payment Account or Payee information, or if you otherwise do not give complete, correct and current instructions so that a funds transfer or bill payment can be made;
<br></br>
7.      If you do not authorize a bill payment or transfer soon enough for your payment to be made and properly credited by the Payee by the Due Date;
<br></br>
8.      If a timely bill payment is made but the Payee nevertheless does not credit your payment promptly after receipt;
<br></br>
9.      If withdrawals from any accounts have been prohibited by a court order such as a garnishment or other legal process;
<br></br>
10.     If we or our agent reasonably believes that a transaction may be unauthorized and based thereon the transaction is not completed;
<br></br>
11.     If your Computer was not working properly such that it interfered with your attempt to authorize a funds transfer or bill payment;
<br></br>
12.     If circumstances beyond our or our agent's control prevent making a funds transfer or bill payment. Such circumstances include but are not limited to computer failure, telecommunication outages, postal strikes and other labor unrest, delays caused by payees, fires, floods, and other natural disasters, terrorist acts or war.
<br></br>
13.     In any other set of circumstances as set forth in your account agreements.
<br></br>

<h4>DISCLOSURE OF ACCOUNT INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</h4>
1.      You authorize us to disclose to third parties, affiliates, and agents, such as independent auditors, consultants or attorneys, information you have provided or that we or our affiliates have obtained about your accounts and the transfers you make:
<br></br>
2.      To comply with laws, government agency rules or orders, court orders, subpoenas or other legal process or in order to give information to any government agency or official having legal authority to request such information;
<br></br>
3.      To verify the existence and condition of your account for a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant;
<br></br>
4.      When necessary to complete any type of transfers and any type of bill payments;
<br></br>
5.      To provide services relating to your account or to offer other products and services;
<br></br>
6.      When we have entered into an agreement to have another party provide the Online Bill Pay service or receive your account information, we will provide the third party with information about your linked checking, savings or other deposit accounts, your Services transactions, and your electronic mail messages in order to carry out your instructions; or
<br></br>
7.      If you provide us your permission.
<br></br>

<h4>STATEMENT OF RECORD</h4>
1.      If you receive paper and electronic statements, any account information provided by the Services is not the statement of record. The periodic statement that is mailed to you will be the statement of record. If you have chosen to stop receiving paper statements, the periodic statement provided to you electronically will be the statement of record. In any case, you are responsible for reviewing any statement and other account communications sent to you by postal mail. Any mailed statement and other account communications will continue to contain important information about your account(s), regardless of whether you access your account(s) through the Services or whether you have chosen to receive your statement electronically.

<h4>TERMINATION</h4>
1.      We reserve the right to terminate this Agreement and your access to the Services, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason. Without limiting the foregoing, if you do not access the Services and there has been no activity on any of your accounts through the Services (such as an automatic bill payment) for any consecutive 120-day period, and there is no such activity pending as of the end of such 120-day period, we reserve the right to terminate your access to the Services. If any of your checking, savings or other deposit accounts is closed due to insufficient funds or any other reason, such account will no longer appear in your online banking profile. If any other account is closed for any reason, such account may no longer appear in your online banking profile.
<br></br>
2.      If you wish to terminate your ability to use Online Bill Pay or the Services as a whole (it being understood that your termination of Online Bill Pay will not terminate your ability to access and use any other part of the Services, but your termination of the Services will automatically terminate your ability to access and use Online Bill Pay), please call 1-877-442-3764 or send us cancellation instructions in writing to bank, Post Office Box 152402 Irving, Texas 75015 ATTN: Customer Service.

Upon termination of Online Bill Pay or the Services as a whole, we will endeavor to cancel any applicable account transactions you have previously authorized, provided that we make no guarantee that we will be able to do so. You will be solely responsible for any fees that apply to any such cancellation. Any payment(s) or other transactions that we are not able to cancel or that have already been processed before the requested termination date will be completed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Scheduled Payments, including without limitation recurring payments, must be voided prior to cancellation of the Online Bill Pay service. Termination shall not affect your liability or obligations under this Agreement for any transactions initiated prior to termination.
